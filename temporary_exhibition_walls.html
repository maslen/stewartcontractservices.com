            <p>We specialise in the installation of temporary exhibition walls, to each clients own specification. The main difference with our installations is that Art work can be hung directly from it, unlike many exhibition contractors where the panel surfaces cannot be attached to in any way.  Our exhibition panels are all fire rated to H&amp;S regulations.</p>
